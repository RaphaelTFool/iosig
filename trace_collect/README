CHANGE LOG
==========

The following changes are newly added to this version.

- The library now works with all recent release of MPICH2, from mpich2-1.1.1p1
  to mpich2-1.4.1p1.
- For each operation, the finish time is also traced.

==========
TO COMPILE
==========

Modify following two variants in Makefile. 'MPIPATH' should be the path to the configured source code of MPICH2, and 'INSTALL_DIR' is recommended to set as the same path as the '--prefix' option used during MPICH2's configuration.

    MPIPATH         = /your/path/to/mpich2-1.4 
    INSTALL_DIR     = /your/path/to/mpich2-install

Then, make.

    $ make
    $ make install

==================
TO USE THE LIBRARY
==================

Compile mpi program using the collecting trace library by adding
 '-liosig' flags to compile command.
eg: mpicc -o test_mpiio test_mpiio.c  -liosig

Or add '-L/your/path/to/mpich2-install/lib -liosig' if the path cannot be found by 'make'.
