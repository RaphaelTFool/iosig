IOSIG software is a toolkit developed by Scalable Computing Software Lab at
Illinois Institute of Technology. In our previous work, we designed and
developed several performance optimization techniques for parallel I/O systems.
Many of the techniques is application-aware that can utilize the I/O
characteristics information of the applications to improve I/O system's
efficiency. We use IOSIG to collect and analyze applications' I/O
characteristics, which works in two steps: 1) IOSIG trace collector records the
trace of all the I/O operations of the application, 2) the IOSIG trace analyzer
analyzes the trace files and recognizes the data access patterns.

During our usage of the original IOSIG toolkit in our I/O optimization works,
we have found some new requirements for IOSIG. We decide to improve IOSIG to a
new tool called IOSIG+.
