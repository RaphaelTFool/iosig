This is the example on IO tracing. 

The program is a tailored version of the IOR benchmark, with only mpiio part.

Follow the following steps to build and run the program.

1. Setup paths. Located in Makefile.config, line 44~48.
2. Build the program
   $ make
3. Run the program
   $ mpiexec -np 1 ./IOR -a MPIIO -b 24m -o /tmp/datafile -w -k -t 4k
   You may use multiple processes, and each process will have one trace file.
